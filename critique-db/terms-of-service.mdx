## Experimental Nature of the Service
Critique DB utilizes an agentic search engine that applies AI-driven reasoning to user databases. While we make every effort to ground responses in accurate data, the technology is experimental, and we **do not guarantee the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of any output.** 

**Users acknowledge that reliance on Critique DBâ€™s responses is at their own risk.**

## Data Governance & Liability
- **User Data Responsibility:** You retain full ownership and responsibility for any data you provide to Critique DB. We do not assume liability for the correctness or appropriateness of database queries or results.
- **Sharing of Generated Information:** If you choose to share, publish, or act upon information generated by Critique DB, you do so at your own discretion. We are not responsible for any consequences, including regulatory compliance, data governance, or business decisions made based on the output.
- **Third-Party Data Regulations:** Users must ensure that their use of Critique DB complies with all relevant data protection laws and contractual obligations tied to their database content. 

## Limitations of Liability
- **No Warranty:** Critique DB is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, express or implied.
- **No Indirect Damages:** We are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from the use of Critique DB, including but not limited to financial losses, reputational harm, or regulatory penalties.
- **Service Availability:** We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free access to Critique DB and may modify or discontinue the service at any time.

## User Conduct & Restrictions
Users agree **not** to:
- Use Critique DB for illegal or unauthorized purposes.
- Attempt to reverse engineer, tamper with, or misuse the service.
- Input sensitive personal data (e.g., protected health information, financial details) where unauthorized.
