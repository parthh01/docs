# Critique AI for Google Sheets

Critique AI brings **agentic search** directly into Google Sheets, allowing you to perform **LLM-powered, in-line cited** queries within your spreadsheet using the `CRITIQUE` function.

## **Getting Started**

### **Installation**
1. Install the Critique AI Google Sheets add-on from the Google Workspace Marketplace.
2. Open Google Sheets and navigate to `Extensions > Critique API > Set API Key`.
3. Enter your **Critique AI API Key** (available at [Critique Labs Dashboard](https://critique-labs.ai/en/dashboard)).

### **Basic Usage**
The `CRITIQUE` function fetches deeply researched, in-line cited responses based on a search term.

#### **Function Syntax**
```excel
=CRITIQUE(searchTerm, [image_url], [exclude_domains], [show_sources])
```

#### **Parameters**
| Parameter         | Required | Type    | Description |
|------------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `searchTerm`      | Yes      | String  | The query you want to search. |
| `image_url`       | No       | String  | URL of an image to analyze. |
| `exclude_domains` | No       | String  | Comma-separated websites you don't want the AI to use. |
| `show_sources`    | No       | Boolean | `TRUE` (default) to include citations. |

#### **Example Queries**
```excel
=CRITIQUE("What is quantum computing?")
=CRITIQUE("Latest AI research", , "cnn.com,foxnews.com", TRUE)
=CRITIQUE("what is the latest stock price of the company in the image? ", "https://example.com/image.jpg")
=CRITIQUE(CONCATENATE("Find some information for the following company: ",A2))
```

## **Limitations**
- **Rate Limits:** Free tier users can make up to **10 API calls per minute**.
- **Token Limits:** No token limit, but large queries may take longer to process.
- **Dependency on API Key:** Users must set an API key before using the function.
- **Excessive Requests:** Overuse may result in rate-limiting errors (`Rate limited, please try again in a minute`).

## **Privacy Policy**
Critique AI does not store or share your search queries. However, **users must not share their API key** or embed it in shared Google Sheets.

### **Data Handling**
- Queries are **processed in real-time** and not stored.
- API keys are stored **locally within the user's Google Sheets** and are not transmitted elsewhere.
- Image URLs provided are only used for analysis and are not retained.

- **No Warranty:** The service is provided "as is" without guarantees of uptime or accuracy.
