## Critique AI

The founding motivation was that the large language models themselves are growing in sophistication, but it is only when coupled with agency that they are able to exercise their synthesis and reasoning capabilities towards actions. As such, it stands to reason that making these systems more performant necessitates the methods of coupling agency to grow in sophistication at the same rate that the underlying models are. To that end, we set about to build an engine; one that tackles the most generic and versatile of tasks: search. it's utility and performance has enabled us to build the two main vectors that we currently offer: 

1. An API platform that allows users to create, deploy, and monetize AI-powered APIs to more than just the basic CRUD operations that most demos for leading agentic software builders offer. 
2. A browser extension that offer autonomous fact-checking and interactivity with all web content you browse. (itself built using API's from the API platform)

## The Foundational Technology: Agentic Search Engine

Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, which rely on static indexed data, Critique AI's agentic search engine dynamically searches the web, follows links, and recursively explores related topics to provide the most up-to-date and comprehensive responses. Our approach to information retrieval mirrors human research, making it especially valuable for complex queries requiring nuanced understanding.
