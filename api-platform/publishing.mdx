## Revenue Model

When Pro users utilize your published API, you earn credits based on their usage:

- You earn $0.05 per million tokens when Pro users use your published APIs
- Enterprise usage provides further revenue opportunities

<Callout type="info">
  The more users that integrate your API into their applications, the more credits you earn!
</Callout>

## Publishing Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Design & Test">
    First design a private API at [https://critique-labs.ai/design](https://critique-labs.ai/design):
    - Provide an initial prompt to design the API (a chat-like interface will be available soon)
    - Review the API inputs and make sure they make sense for the API you want to create
    - Check the generated endpoint stub (i.e., /my-cool-api) and make sure it looks right. Note that sometimes a unique identifier is added to the end of the stub (i.e., /my-cool-api/{unique-id}). This is fine and expected.
    - IMPORTANT: Check the configuration instructions and make sure you cover all the cases you want to support as well as the cases you don't want to support
    - MOST IMPORTANT: Test the API to ensure it works as expected. If you don't like the output, you can edit the configuration instructions and test again.
