## Agentic API Builder: Beyond CRUD

Critique AI extends agentic search into a powerful **API platform**, enabling users to prompt their way to production-ready APIs that go beyond standard CRUD operations. Unlike conventional API providers that focus on simple data storage and retrieval, Critique AIâ€™s agentic API builder allows for:

- **Dynamic, intelligent processing** using agentic search capabilities.
- **Automated multi-step reasoning and execution**, adapting to the complexity of each request.
- **Composable API design**, where users can build and monetize their own AI-driven endpoints on the marketplace.

For a deep dive into how the API platform works, read our blog post: [What is Agentic Search](https://critiquebrowser.app/en/blog/What-Is-Agentic-Search).

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Design">
    Describe your API's functionality using natural language
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate">
    Our platform uses a multi agent system instantiated as a DAG to create a production-ready API that is deployed and ready to use.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Optional: Publish">
   Publish your API to the marketplace and earn revenue from its (paid) usage.
